I can’t believe he is coming back out to the stage of history after all these years.<br/>ES3: And Jinbei is completely turned against us now. We were hoping for   him to become the symbol of peace between the races… it’s too bad.<br/>ES4: The balace of the three powers is in shambles. How should we fill in the three vacant seats for the Seven Warlords?<br/>ES5: We should wait till the forces in the New World make their moves.   Surely the faction territories amongst the pirates will change.<br/>We must choose someone more influential…<br/><br/>ES1:In the New World, Blackbeard is already on his move.<br/>I heard one of those 100million+ rookie was taken out by him already.<br/>ES2: No surprise, he knows Whitebeard’s territory very well.<br/>ES3: Amongst the pirates going after Whitebeard’s vacant seat, I’d say Blackbeard is leading one stop ahead.<br/>There’s never been a person who ate two devil fruits reported in history.<br/>ES4: The only one capable of stopping him would be…. one of the Four Emperors. (rest cut off)<br/>ES5: The “D”s always causes trouble…! Just like Portgas…. (rest cut off)<br/><br/>They sailed and circled around Marineford once, in a tradition of “water funeral”.<br/>Then Luffy boldly infiltrated the plaza alone, and went to the Ox bell and rang it 16 times.<br/>Then he tossed a bouquet into the ruin of the plaza, and bowed his head in prayer.<br/><br/>At Kong’s office, Sengoku is meeting with the World Government Commander-in-Chief Kong.<br/>Apparently Sengoku is resigning from his position.<br/>It seems Garp has alrady visited Kong to do the same.<br/>Kong convinced both of them to stay with the marines to train the younglings.<br/>He is saddened to see two marines who led the force at the frontlines since Roger’s age stepping down.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, at the medic room, Coby and Helmeppo are recovering.<br/>The doctor tells Coby the symptoms he is suffering is a form of haki.<br/>He explains that Vice Admiral class marines all can use haki.<br/>Coby feels uncomfortable about the “strong presence of others” he is feeling.<br/>The doc tells him to go learn more about haki from Garp, so that he can control it.<br/>Helmeppo seems jealous that Coby is a step ahead of him, and wants to catch up.<br/><br/>At Aokiji’s office, Smoker is chatting with Aokiji.<br/>Aokiji wonders what Luffy’s “Sixteen Bell” message means.<br/>Smoker doesn’t care, and asks him what happened to his request to be transferred.<br/>Aokiji tells Smoker he must be nuts wanting to go to G5. It’s infamous for problems.<br/>Marine GS 5th division… otherwise known as the New World outpost.<br/><br/><strong>Credit:</strong> Aohige<br/><strong>Source:</strong> OM<br/><br/>the latter half<br/><br/>Meanwhile the New World is in turmoil….<br/>Several Supernovas have arrived at various islands.<br/><br/>Hawkins: I’m sorry, can you repeat that? I couldn’t hear you well.<br/>Brownbeard: I said, I am BROWNBEARD! The almight Brownbeard, with bounty of 80 million!!!<br/>Remember my name!! This is MY territory!!<br/>Hawkins: Oh, I see. Your name is so stupid, I thought I heard you wrong.<br/>Let me tell you two things…. first, I hate jokes.<br/>Brownbeard: Joke!?<br/>Hawkins: And second…. I see death in your future.<br/><br/>Urouge finds himself stumped in front of an island. He and his crew can’t get on an island.<br/>The island is under constant bombardment of lightning strikes.<br/>(according to the summary, an old woman appears here and offers him umbrella)<br/><br/>Capone is eating a meal in his ship, when… a massive black ball in the sky gravitates his ship to it.<br/>With some screams, the ship is engulfed into the Gantz… I mean black ball. (and according to the summary, crushed)<br/><br/>Kid is seen crucifying a pirate who dared to fight them.<br/>He says he is disappointed that this is what New World has to offer… cowardly, weak pirates.<br/>Kid is reading the newspaper, and sees Luffy infiltrating the Marineford again.<br/>He wonders if that’s his message to the world that the era belongs to him now.<br/>His crew tells him it has to be a reason like that, if he was willing to go back and face his trauma of losing his brother.<br/><br/>Luffy is on the Amazon Lily ship, being tendered by the amazons.<br/>He apologizes to them for making them sail so long.<br/>He asks them what they are doing (pinching him and stretching him)<br/>They are watching over Luffy so he stays put to heal his wounds, by the order from Hancock.<br/>Hancock is resting after being so excited over Luffy.<br/>Luffy wonders if his crew got his message.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, around the world, the Strawhats are reading the papers.<br/>Chopper: I get it Luffy!! I understand your message!!<br/>Franky is seen with half his face blown off, and other parts of his body damaged.<br/>Zoro is the only one who seems to be confused (according to the summary) reading the news. <strong>Credits:</strong> aohige<br/><strong>Verification: </strong> <strong>Confirmed</strong><br/><br/>3rd Part<br/><br/>Luffy is on the Amazon Lily ship, being tendered by the amazons.<br/>He apologizes to them for making them sail so long.<br/>He asks them what they are doing (pinching him and stretching him)<br/>They are watching over Luffy so he stays put to heal his wounds, by the order from Hancock.<br/>Hancock is resting after being so excited over Luffy.<br/>Luffy wonders if his crew got his message.<br/>From ohana’s summary….<br/><br/>Sengoku and Garp resigned from their position, but Kong asked them to keep their title at least, and stay in the marine.<br/>Sengoku agrees, and Kong says he wants to recommend Aokiji as the next Fleet Admiral.<br/><br/>ohana also says it’s an old man approaching Urouge, asking if he wants an umbrella.<br/><br/>The first half of Grandline is referred to as “Paradise” by those in the New World.<br/><br/>Also, Brownbeard pulled out a knife when Hawkins says his fortune<br/>He was most likely taken out by Hawkins.<br/><br/>ohana also says there’s no preview message for next week. (hmm…)<br/><br/>The meaning of the bell is explained by Killer.<br/>Normally, you ring 8 times at the end of the year.<br/>Then 8 times again at the start of the year.<br/>Ringing the bell total of 16 times is a traditon of the marines.<br/>In other words… the bell is a symbol of ending and starting of an era.<br/><br/>Well, we haven’t seen the finishing pages yet, so maybe there’s surprise for us still.<br/><br/>One Piece 594 raw Spoiler is also current in developing process and  it will be  available according to the scheduled release date.
