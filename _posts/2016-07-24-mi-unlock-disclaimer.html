<div id="neirong">   <div class="item item0">          Disclaimer<br />     <ol><li>By unlocking the device you agree that this may bring changes to some parts of the system. These changes may damage the device;</li><li>After the device is unlocked, it becomes less secure and more  vulnerable to malware attacks, which may lead to the disclosure and loss  of your private data; </li><li> Some features which require high security level (e.g., Find device, added-value services, etc.) will no longer be available; </li><li>After the device is unlocked, some features will be changed.  Thus, you might no longer be able to receive regular updates and enjoy  newest features of MIUI.</li></ol>The risks stated above do not fully cover changes which may be  brought about by Mi Unlock.We will keep improving Mi Unlock in order to  prevent the cases when unauthorised vendors unlock Mi devices to install  third party apps which worsen MIUI user experience and cannot be  deleted. Locked devices also provide you with high-quality security  features, such as Find device, and other added-value services. We're  sorry for any inconveniences our policies may cause. <br />     Thank you for understanding!<br />    </div></div>
