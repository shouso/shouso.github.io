<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>Leave aside being able to tolerate the sound<br/>of the call to prayer, European capitals,<br/>which are the fortresses of modern<br/>civilization, haven’t even been able to<br/>resolve the debate on minarets<br/>Akif Emre<br/>It was a balmy spring evening… That<br/>evening marked my first visit to Granada.<br/>The Alhambra was opposite me as the sun<br/>set in Mirador San Nicolas… The coral red<br/>of the setting sun lit up the Alhambra. A<br/>red sun was sinking below the horizon.<br/>The walls of the Alhambra were covered<br/>in a dark red as the last rays of sunlight<br/>fell upon them.<br/>I felt two types of melancholy combined<br/>into one as I stood on a hill in Granada<br/>from where the best view of the Alhambra<br/>is available. We were looking at the<br/>Alhambra from the place that gets its<br/>name from the San Nicolas Church.<br/>Anyone who pays careful attention to the<br/>church will feel like it is whispering “I<br/>used to be a mosque once upon a time.”<br/>Standing atop the tallest hill in Granada’s<br/>historic quarter of Albayzin, and rising<br/>amidst the Carmen-type houses unique to<br/>Andalusia with gardens and courtyards,<br/>the bell tower maintains its resemblance<br/>to a classic Andalusia-Maghreb type<br/>minaret. A bell was attached to it by<br/>making a minor change…<br/>As the last rays of sunlight faded slowly<br/>from the snowcapped peaks of the Sierra<br/>Nevada mountain range that lie beyond<br/>the Alhambra, I was literally startled out<br/>of the depths of the historical wanderings<br/>my mind had embarked on by a voice. A<br/>chant of “Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar”…<br/>It was like a cry rising from the depths of<br/>history instead of a mechanical sound<br/>emanating from loudspeakers. I suddenly<br/>became alert and listened to the voice…<br/>yes; it was the call to prayer coming from<br/>somewhere very close by.<br/>It was evening and the Muslim call to<br/>prayer was being issued…<br/>A Muslim Spanish friend, Davud Romero,<br/>noticed my surprise, and as if revealing a<br/>previously untold secret, said, “The<br/>mosque is right here. Let us pray there”…<br/>I launched myself in the direction where<br/>the call to prayer was emanating from,<br/>and one street ahead, found myself in<br/>front of the mosque.<br/>I had come here to attend a conference<br/>regarding the Moriscos, who are Muslim<br/>people forced to convert to Christianity<br/>and who were forced to conceal their<br/>Muslim identity long after Granada, the<br/>last pearl of Andalusia had fallen.<br/>Around a million Moriscos were driven<br/>out of their homeland between 1609 and<br/>1612. And for the first time in the history<br/>of modern Spain, a scientific conference<br/>was being held at Granada University to<br/>mark the 500th year of the dispersal. I<br/>was attending along with Burhan Köroğlu,<br/>who is pursuing this topic.<br/>It was as if I was transported to an<br/>unimaginable world where the weight<br/>was lifted off my shoulders and a<br/>lightness took hold of me when the call to<br/>prayer suddenly rose loudly and the<br/>Granada Mosque appeared like an oasis.<br/>It felt like the rediscovery of a lost<br/>heritage when I saw the blueness of the<br/>night and the lights of the Alhambra from<br/>the courtyard facing the Alhambra after<br/>performing my prayer.<br/>The mosque has an interesting story.<br/>Debate ensued in Granada when the<br/>foundations of a mosque were discovered<br/>during excavations. The land was<br/>purchased through an initiative by<br/>Muslims to build a mosque there that<br/>would stay true to the original. But civic<br/>society and the municipality were pitted<br/>against each other. Contrary to what is<br/>believed, the segment of society that<br/>opposed the construction of a mosque<br/>protested vociferously. After a lengthy<br/>struggle, the first call to prayer was made<br/>in Andalusia in 2003, almost 500 years<br/>after the fall of Granada.<br/>The stubborn resistance will increase to<br/>protect the legacy of building a one-<br/>dimensional society that began during the<br/>formation of modern Europe, in the early<br/>modern period, when Muslims and Jews<br/>were driven out and their books burned.<br/>It will take a long time until the Muslim<br/>call to prayer is accepted in Granada.<br/>Being in the most fervent Catholic country<br/>in Europe will undoubtedly have an<br/>impact as well.<br/>It will be even more difficult to see this<br/>acceptance in countries like the United<br/>Kingdom, which is more multicultural and<br/>relatively more liberal, and France, which<br/>considers the principles of equality,<br/>fraternity and liberty as existential ones.<br/>Leave aside being able to tolerate the<br/>sound of the call to prayer, European<br/>capitals, which are the fortresses of<br/>modern civilization, haven’t even been<br/>able to resolve the debate on minarets.<br/>Leave aside the citing of the perception<br/>that a minaret symbolizes Islam’s victory<br/>over Europe; involvement even extends<br/>to mosque architecture and interior<br/>decorations. Even if permission is granted<br/>to build a mosque, the architecture has to<br/>conform to the values of western culture<br/>and aesthetics!<br/>The connection created between mosque<br/>architecture and European values, and the<br/>coercion carried out in this regard<br/>actually provides clues to discussions on<br/>“European Islam” and the creation of a<br/>new type of Islam, which is modernized<br/>and compatible with European values.</div>
