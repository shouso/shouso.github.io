listen.. beautiful song from Yusuf Islam<br/><br/><object height="350" width="425"><br/>      <param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Dh-ln_anjwY"><br/>      <param name="wmode" value="transparent"><br/>      <embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Dh-ln_anjwY;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="350" width="425"><br/>      </object><br/><br/>How great the wonders of the heavens<br/>And the timeless beauty of the night<br/>How great – then how great the Creator?<br/>And its stars like priceless jewels<br/>Far beyond the reach of kings<br/>Bow down for the shepherd guiding him home.<br/><br/>But how many eyes are closed<br/>To the wonder of this night?<br/>Like pearls, hidden, deep beneath a dark<br/>Stream of desires.<br/>But like dreams vanish with the call to prayer<br/>And the dawn extinguishes night – here too are signs.<br/>God is the Light - God is the Light<br/><br/>How great the beauty of the Earth and the creatures<br/>Who dwell on her.<br/>How great – then how great the Creator?<br/>As its mountains pierce the clouds<br/>High above the lives of men<br/>Weeping rivers for thousands of years.<br/><br/>But how many hearts are closed<br/>To the wonders of this sight?<br/>Like birds in a cage, asleep with closed wings<br/>But like work stops with the call to prayer<br/>And the birds reside – here too are signs<br/>God is the Light – God is the Light<br/><br/>How great the works of man and the things he makes<br/>How great – then how great the Creator?<br/>Though he strives to reach the heavens<br/>He can barely survive<br/>The wars of the world he lives in.<br/><br/>Yet, how many times he’s tried,<br/>Himself to immortalise?<br/>Like his parents before him in the Garden of Eden<br/>But like the sun sets with the call to prayer<br/>And surrenders to the night here too are signs<br/>God is the Light Everlasting<br/>God is the Light Everlasting<br/>God is the Light Everlasting<br/>God is the Light Everlasting
