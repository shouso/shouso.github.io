<div class="header"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><h1>Help the GNOME Foundation defend the GNOME trademark against Groupon!</h1></div></div></div></div><div class="container paragraphs"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Update</b> <br /><br />Kabar terakhir, groupon mau untuk mengganti nama aplikasinya bukan gnome lagi .. beritanya <a href="https://engineering.groupon.com/2014/misc/gnome-foundation-and-groupon-product-names/#updated">disini&nbsp;</a><br /><br /><br /><br />"GNOME" has been a familiar name in software for the past 17 years, and a <a href="http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=76368848&amp;caseType=SERIAL_NO&amp;searchType=statusSearch">registered trademark</a> since 2006. The <a href="https://www.gnome.org/">GNOME project</a> has been a staple desktop for GNU/Linux and BSD desktops. It was the  default desktop for Sun Microsystems workstation class machines,  continues to be the default desktop for the Red Hat Enterprise Linux and  SUSE Linux Enterprise Server distributions, and it is the default  desktop of Fedora and Debian. SUSE Linux Enterprise Point of Service  solution for the retail industry is based on GNOME. GNOME technology can  be found in TVs, tablets, phones, consumer devices, and in common  software everywhere.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Recently Groupon announced a product with the same product name as GNOME. Groupon’s product is a <a href="http://investor.groupon.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=848707">tablet based point of sale</a> “operating system for merchants to run their entire operation." The  GNOME community was shocked that Groupon would use our mark for a  product so closely related to the GNOME desktop and technology. It was  almost inconceivable to us that Groupon, with over $2.5 billion in  annual revenue, a full legal team and a huge engineering staff would not  have heard of the GNOME project, found our trademark registration using  a casual search, or even found our website, but we nevertheless got in  touch with them and asked them to pick another name. Not only did  Groupon refuse, but it has now filed even more trademark applications  (the full list of applications they filed can be found <a href="http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=86200190%0A86200193%0A86200194%0A86200196%0A86200657%0A86200661%0A86200759%0A86200763%0A86200765%0A86227618%0A&amp;caseType=SERIAL_NO&amp;searchType=multiStatus">here</a>, <a href="http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=86287930%0A86287935%0A86287938%0A86287940%0A86287946%0A86287951%0A&amp;caseType=SERIAL_NO&amp;searchType=multiStatus">here</a> and <a href="http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=86441913%0A86441922%0A86441923%0A86441925%0A86441926%0A86441930%0A86441933%0A86441934%0A86441937%0A86441941%0A86441945%0A86441951%0A&amp;caseType=SERIAL_NO&amp;searchType=multiStatus">here</a>).  To use the GNOME name for a proprietary software product that is  antithetical to the fundamental ideas of the GNOME community, the free  software community and the GNU project is outrageous. Please help us  fight this huge company as they try to trade on our goodwill and hard  earned reputation.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">We want to show that our brand matters and that you care.  Of the 28 trademark applications Groupon filed, we have to file formal  proceedings to oppose 10 of them by December 3, 2014. Help us raise the  funds to fight back and most of all call public attention to this  terrible behavior by Groupon. Help us make sure that when people hear  about GNOME software they learn about freedom and not proprietary  software.  Our counsel has advised us that we will need $80,000 to  oppose the registration of the first set of 10 applications. If we are  able to defend the mark without spending this amount, we will use the  remaining funds to bolster and improve GNOME. Please help us raise the  money to protect GNOME's trademark and strengthen Free Software!</div><div class="row" style="text-align: justify;"><div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3"><div class="donate-share-container"><div class="spread-the-word">Spread the word on: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://gnome.org/groupon/&amp;t=Help%20the%20GNOME%20Foundation%20defend%20the%20GNOME%20trademark%20against%20Groupon%21%20Please%20donate%20at%20https://gnome.org/groupon/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://gnome.org/groupon/">Google+</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Help%20the%20GNOME%20Foundation%20%28@gnome%29%20defend%20the%20GNOME%20trademark%20against%20Groupon%21%20To%20%23defendGNOME%20please%20donate%20at&amp;url=https://gnome.org/groupon/&amp;related=gnome">Twitter</a></div></div></div></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This legal defense is not just about protecting  GNOME's trademark; it is about asserting to the corporate world that  FLOSS trademarks can and will be guarded. Not just by the project in  question, but by the community as a whole. As a result, all FLOSS  trademarks will be strengthened at once.<br />-- Lucas Nussbaum, Debian Project Leader</div><div style="text-align: justify;">GNOME has been an integral part of the free and open source  universe for over a decade and half, and is a vital component of  Fedora's desktop operating system. I'm shocked and saddened that a  company which describes itself as <a href="https://engineering.groupon.com/2014/open-source/sharing-is-caring-open-source-at-groupon/">"fueled by open source software"</a> would even consider muddying the waters by launching proprietary  software with the same name. That's confusing, destructive, and  disrespectful. Please join me in asking Groupon to change their plans,  and in contributing to the GNOME Foundation's defense.<br />-- Matthew Miller, Fedora Project Leader</div><div style="text-align: justify;">GNOME has been one of the hallmarks and foundation for the  open source community for over 15 years.  We are outraged that Groupon  would attempt to insinuate that its proprietary software and products  have anything to do with the GNOME community and years of trust and good  will that GNOME has built over the years.  We stand by GNOME in  protecting its trademark and encourage everyone in the open source and  free software community to do the same.<br />-- Andrew Lee, Private Internet Access co-founder and Chief Content Officer</div></div></div></div>
